Description: RSVSim is a package for the simulation of deletions, insertions, inversion, tandem-duplications and translocations of various sizes in any genome available as FASTA-file or BSgenome data package. SV breakpoints can be placed uniformly accross the whole genome, with a bias towards repeat regions and regions of high homology (for hg19) or at user-supplied coordinates.
